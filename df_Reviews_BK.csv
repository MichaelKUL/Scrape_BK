2,2022-10-20,A pretty efficient Burger King with plenty of screens to place orders on plus a drinks machine offering a wide range of choice. The food came quickly even though I'd requested a variation from the standard Whopper and the seating area is pretty clean. However...it was annoying the way a staffer tried to snatch my tray when I hadn't finished my drink and the restaurant was not under heavy pressure to turnover seats.More,TripAdvisor
3,2022-08-09,"We only nipped into Burger King to go to the toilet. Unfortunately, this branch of BK have made the executive decision to lock their toilets.

The million dollar question is why?

No point having a public toilet if the general public can't use them. Absolutely...useless!

Can't comment on the food/drink, however.More",TripAdvisor
4,2022-04-12,"This branch of Burger King has gone fully vegan for a month which I think is fab and just shows what change is happening with people opening their eyes to what goes on in meat/dairy production. It was so good to eat at a main...stream fast food outlet where everything on the menu was vegan and the place was busy too!

I only hope that Burger King decide to have some permanent vegan outlets as that would be really good.

ðŸŒ± FTW!More",TripAdvisor
5,2022-04-11,"At about 10:30 on a Saturday night, the only choices available are fries and vegan options. Many people just didnâ€™t order and left. Others just got fries. You probably  get just about 10 fries. The revamped branch isnâ€™t good. Poor choice and poor value for...money. Clearly theyâ€™ve upped prices to pay for the refurb.More",TripAdvisor
6,2021-12-31,"Very busy, staff working hard. Burgers and Fries were fresh and tasty. Fairly clean. Maybe more staff needed.",TripAdvisor
7,2021-12-30,"Service was relatively quick. Staff member taking our order was polite and efficient, double-checked our meals before pushing trays towards us. However, we ordered 4 kids meals and the kids didnt get a toy as they were supposed to. Food was ok, chips were freshly...cooked and burgers/nuggets were hot.

Now the toilets. I have genuinely never seen public toilets so bad. There were 5 cubicles in the ladies, 3 of which were out of use with a sign on the door but only 1 was physically locked. The 2 that were 'usable' were unhygienic, and to be honest a health hazard in themselves. Toilet roll scraps (some looked clean, other bits definitely weren't!) all over the floors, pee on the seat of 1 toilet, overflowing sanitary bins in both cubicles and no toilet roll available in any cubicle (we even checked the out of order ones just in case.) My daughter was desperate for a pee but looked and said ""I'd rather wet myself than go in there, I think I'll just hold it""
My son went in the men's toilet so I hovered nearby to check he was ok. I could smell the toilets from about 2 metres away from the entrance. My son came out and said he didn't want to actually pee in there but couldn't wait any longer, however if there was no urinal he would have walked out - he only went because he didn't have to actually touch anything.

After leaving Burger King, we went straight over the square to the 'other' big chain restaurant (my kids have never had a BK so I promised my son if he tried it and didn't like it then we'd go to the other place to get him something to eat.) Yes, we had a 10 minute queue to get in, but what a different experience. Staff were constantly cleaning (everything from cleaning tables, wiping handrails and mopping the stairs - which was being done as we went down to seating area, then was being done again as we were on our way out of the restaurant) and toilets were well stocked and clean. Would definitely rather queue at the competitor than experience BK Leicester Square again.More",TripAdvisor
8,2021-11-05,"Visited when we first arrived in London on Monday, never again. Food was so horrible I threw it away and went to the Mcdonalds across the square, staff had a foul attitude and just couldn't be bothered. Wouldn't reccomend.",TripAdvisor
9,2021-09-11,"Went to this Burger King because there was hardly anyone there and the other major burger chain had people queuing outside. While I was ordering a cheeseburger and medium fries the 'orderperson' kept trying to 'upsell' to a larger order.I repeated I wanted medium fries....After a delay (it's supposed to be a fast food joint) I got my order and when I looked in the bag there were no fries! Â£8-18 for a cheeseburger and fries with no fries! I went back to the counter but the bloke was off doing something else and no-one was at the counter serving. The lady behind me said ""a mouse! .... I've just seen a mouse!"" then ""It's there under the shelf!"" and a couple of seconds later ""Oh I can't eat here!"" and left. I threw The cheeseburger in the bin. Really appalling service and apparently really appalling hygiene. Still, I've learned my lesson and won't be wasting my time or money at that place again.More",TripAdvisor
